# Sure-Independent-Screening-For-Classification
This my final year project in SYSU as an undergraduate. Inspired by a data analysis work I did with the hospital, I want to compare the performance of so many SIS method in the circumstances that Y is binary. I choose SIS, Iterative-SIS, DC-SIS, MV-SIS, MDC-SIS, SIRS and the method proposed by my tutor, Bcor-SIS and Iterative Bcor-SIS. Hopefully, this will help people to decide which method to use in different situations like imbalanced situations, collinearity, X is from normal or t or multinomial distributions.  This project will archive all the R code in my paper too, I found that some of the R packages are not satisfying for my research so I wrote it myself.
